# GUI-Based-Signal-Modifier

Overview
This project is a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a 6-band audio equalizer. The equalizer allows users to adjust the audio levels for different frequency bands in real-time.

Features
Six adjustable frequency bands:

Frequencies less than 200 Hz
Frequencies between 200 Hz and 1 kHz
Frequencies between 1 kHz and 2 kHz
Frequencies between 2 kHz and 3 kHz
Frequencies between 3 kHz and 4 kHz
Frequencies greater than 4 kHz
Real-time audio equalization: Users can dynamically control the gain (amplitude) for each frequency band using sliders.

User-friendly GUI: The graphical interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the equalizer.
